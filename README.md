Django-based home station which will integrate a number of different tasks.

## Web Photo Frame
First service to cover downloading images from google drive and showing them on a presentation-style format.

Objectives:
1. Make use of an old tablet.
2. Organize photos based on date, location and any more user provided data. (OpenCV for face recognition? why not)


## Arduino Client
Since this service will be implemented nearby an existing Arduino-based station, it is desired to be able to work as gateway between Alexa and bluetooth.
As for now, It should be able to despatch ON/OFF commands for a string of leds connected to the arduino.
